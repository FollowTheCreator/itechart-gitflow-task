# Device information 
##### *Name* 
iPhone X 
##### *Description* 
Apple CEO Tim Cook called the new iPhone X “the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone,” and it’s easy to see why. The OLED display — an iPhone first — is called the Super Retina Display and measures 5.8 inches, with a resolution of 2,436 × 1,125 pixels. It features Dolby Vision and HDR10 for stunning high-contrast video playback, as well as TrueTone dynamic white-balance adjustment, a feature of the 10.5-inch iPad Pro and the new iPhone 8 models. The screen takes up the whole screen and there’s no home button — you unlock your phone with your face. Oh, and it’s water- and dust-resistant, and capable of charging wirelessly.
